    "\n",
    "1. **Constructing a 95% Confidence Interval**:\n",
    "   - Bootstrap multiple resamples from your data and calculate the mean of each resample.\n",
    "   - Calculate the SEM from the bootstrapped sample means.\n",
    "   - Use the formula for the confidence interval: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm Z \\times \\text{SEM}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the original sample mean and \\(Z\\) is the Z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Role of the Z-Score**:\n",
    "   - The Z-score controls the width of the confidence interval. For a **95% confidence level**, the Z-score is **1.96**, covering the central 95% of a normal distribution.\n",
    "   - The Z-score is multiplied by the SEM to determine how far to extend the confidence interval above and below the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score plays a critical role in scaling the SEM to provide the desired confidence interval coverage."
