    "1. **Initial Monte Hall Code**:\n",
    "   - The provided code simulates the Monty Hall problem by making a contestant initially pick a door, and then the host reveals a door with a goat.\n",
    "   - The contestant always switches doors, and the simulation counts how often this strategy leads to winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improvements**:\n",
    "   - We simplified the code to avoid unnecessary list manipulations, used more efficient array operations, and made the switching logic clearer.\n",
    "   - The final code is concise, improving both performance and readability."
